## So...

So this tool is just quick ugly script to get emails from Google for a later phishing attack. It was written after i could not find any tool that will allow me to find  emails by company from Google without an API/too many false-positives which were useless to try and sort through. This will give many false-positives but in a way which is easier to sort (did not filter by domain since many companies have several domains with variations to the domain name).

It is written horribly and will hog your memory (it saves non of the HTML source codes to disk but only runs through them in memory. And even that it does not preform one by one, but in bulks!). It's ugly, undocumented and requires you to read the code before running it. Probably no updates and maintenance will be made. You can submit you code changes to the [GitHub Page](https://www.github.com/ytisf/CreepyCrawler) but ideas or blueprints will not be made so if you wish you can upload your changes to the code and they will probably be merged.

Good luck.
